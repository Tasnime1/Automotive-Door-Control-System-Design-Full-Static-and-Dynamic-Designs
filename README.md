# Automotive Door Control System Design | Full Static and Dynamic Designs

* Two ECUs communicating together via CAN Bus to control car lights according to door state, light switch state and car speed state.

* As an overview the system consists of the following:
    * Two microcontrollers connected via CAN bus.
    *  One Door sensor (D).
    *  One Light switch (L).
    *  One Speed sensor (S).
    *  ECU 1 connected to D, S, and L, all input devices.
    *  Two lights, right (RL) and left (LL).
    *  One buzzer (B).
    *  ECU 2 connected to RL, LL, and B, all output devices.
 
* A detailed report is provvided with all project APIs, state machines, sequence diagrams, CPU Load...etc.
